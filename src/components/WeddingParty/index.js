                                                is always in debate. History has
                                                proven Rebekah can take Grace in
                                                a fight.

                                                greatest gifts "growing up" has
                                                offered. After college, Grace
                                                and Rebekah became roommates and
                                                they absolutely loved it!
                                                Rebekah will never forget the
                                                days they didn't have a dish
                                                washer and the nights they ate
                                                Totinos party pizzas (still do!)
                                                and stayed up late learning the
                                                lyrics to the Frozen Soundtrack.
                                                Grace is Rebekah's best friend
                                                and confidant. Rebekah is so
                                                lucky.

                                                apart and haven't always seen
                                                eye to eye. Literally: Carter is
                                                4 inches taller than his older
                                                brother. As the years
                                                progressed, Carter stopped
                                                pretending to fall over hurt
                                                while playing baseball in the
                                                front yard and the two became
                                                the best of friends.
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                Although Carter lives in Kansas
                                                City, MO and Ross in Austin, TX,
                                                Ross didn't want anyone else by
                                                his side on this day.
